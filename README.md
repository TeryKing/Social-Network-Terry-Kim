# Social Network Terry Kim
Social Network Application by Terry Kim

This application will be using Insomnia to create a social network database where we can add users, delete users, add thoughts, delete thoughts, and add reactions

This uses a basic routing system where each GET, POST, and DELETE will update the users and their thoughts. 

-When a user is created, they have a specific ID which can be searched specifically using that ID.

-When a user creates a thought, that thought will also have a specific ID which can be searched.

-All IDs via thoughts and users can be deleted and searched using /api/thoughts(or user)/(ID#)
